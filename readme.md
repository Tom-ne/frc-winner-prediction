## Introduction

The First Robotics Competition (FRC) is an annual robotics competition that brings together high school students, mentors, and robots to compete in various challenges. Predicting the outcome of matches can be a fun and educational exercise in machine learning and data analysis. This project leverages the TBA API to gather match data and trains an SVM model to predict the winning alliance.

## Features

- Fetches match data from the TBA API for the 2023 FRC season.
- Processes and prepares data for training.
- Trains an SVM model to predict the winning alliance.
- Provides predictions for upcoming matches.

## Data

The data is fetched from the TBA API and includes information about matches, teams, and results for the 2023 FRC season. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before training the model.

## Model

The SVM (Support Vector Machine) model is used to predict the winning alliance of a match. The model is trained using features derived from the match data, such as team rankings, scores, and other relevant statistics.
